                        <p>My government name is "Michael Bernhart," but my mom calls me "Mr. Beans!" I have the best parents a dog could ever ask for- my dad is an ADK 46er and my mom was recently featured in a magazine! In my spare time I love hiking, walking, eating, sniffing the yard, showing off my lambchop, and concentrating on sleeping.   </p>

                        <p>I'm an adventure dog through and through. I've completed a few of the Adirondack High Peaks myself, with the most recent being "Big Slide," which I completed in August 2022.  </p>

                        <h3>Lambchops For ALL DOGS</h3>
                        <p>Our primary mission here at the Mr. Beans Project is to advocate for all dogs to have their very own Lambchop. No dog should have to face the world's injustices without the emotional support of a Lambchop companion.</p>

                        <h3>Looking Out For One Another</h3>  
                        <p>Everybody deserves to feel safe in their own home. As the CEO of the Mr. Beans Foundation, I have taken on the sole responsibility of guardian and protector of this home and yard. I dare you to walk by this yard without getting BOOFED at.  </p>

                        <h3>Eliminating Food Waste</h3>
                        <p>You can trust me to take care of any food waste and all left over matters responsibly. Here at the Mr. Beans Project, we understand the privilege it is to have all the snackies all the time and recognize not all dogs are so fortunate. No snacks left behind (except cucumber slices).</p>
